# About the OPP Chorus

The Ontario Provincial Police Chorus is a vibrant community choir dedicated to bringing people together through the joy of singing. We welcome singers of all backgrounds and skill levels, and our repertoire spans a wide range of musical styles, from classical choral works to broadway hits to contemporary favourites.

The Chorus was originally formed to sing at the annual national and provincial police memorials, held in Ottawa and Toronto, respectively. 
We have since expanded to performing at many community events, seniors' residences, places of worship, and fundraisers throughout Ontario, sharing our passion for music with the wider community.

## Our Mission
To foster a love of music, promote musical excellence, and build community through choral singing.

## Rehearsals
We rehearse weekly on Wednesday evenings in Barrie from September to June.
